## Chapter 1
This chapter is about the goals of the linux Foundation 
and includes a brief overview of 3 major Linux distribution families.
The primary goal of the Linux foundation is to provide a neutral space 
for individuals, companies, and representatives to learn about 
and connect with the linux community. It's secondary goal is to
sponsor Linus Torvolds and the Linux Kernel project. 
The 3 primary linux distro 
families are:
SUSE which include openSUSE?
Fedora wich includes centOS
and Debian which includes
Ubuntu
The primary differences between all of these is, 
differing package managers
and some locations of system files and system and user install files.

## Chapter2
This chapter is 
about the core concepts that 
make up a unix-like OS, the 
organizational structure of linux 
development efforts, and how individual 
developers and users communicate with the vast development community.
It is important to note that all linux 
environment us the philosophy of "everything is a file".
This means almost all aspects of 
the system can be handled using normal file I/O and manipulation tools. This is similar
to how unix is set up and this is by design as Linus wanted to develop
a sort of type of unix that he could use for his computer.

and initialization for Linux.
