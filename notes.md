The 3 primary linux distro families are:
SUSE which include openSUSE?

## Chapter2
This chapter is about the core concepts that make up a unix-like OS, the organizational structure of linux development efforts, and how individual developers and users communicate with the vast development community.
It is important to note that all linux environment us the philosophy of "everything is a file." This means almost all aspects of the system can be handled using normal file I/O and manipulation tools. This is similar to how unix is set up and this is by design as Linus wanted to develop a sort of type of unix that he could use for his computer.
